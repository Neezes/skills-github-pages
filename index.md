## Books

I’m an author of books for teachers, focused strongly on a **cognitive science** approach to education.

<!---
This will automatically grab the title from the first book in books. idk if this is the behaviour you want, you can replace {{site.data.books[0].title}} with just writing the title of whatever book you want, but I do think it's kinda neat
--->
Take a look at [my books page]({{site.baseurl}}/books), featuring my new title, *{{site.data.books[0].title}}*.

## Blog

I **blog** about various issues in education, in particular memory, metacognition, creativity, and evidence-based teaching practice.

The best way to to keep up with these posts is to subscribe **for free** to my Substack newsletter, [Memory and Metacognition Updates](https://firth.substack.com/). New posts every Monday.

## About

I am an academic working across multiple courses and **research projects**. I’d love to hear from prospective doctoral students, or educators who are interested in collaborating with me.
